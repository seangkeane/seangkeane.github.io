    <h3>History</h3>
    <p>History of soccer dates back to Chinese Dynasty, when the game was played using pigs bladders or heads of enemies for a ball. Soccer history as a modern game seen today, starts with the official rules for soccer, made in 1863, at a Freemason's Tavern, located in London.</p>
