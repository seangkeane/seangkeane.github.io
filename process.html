<p>My <b>Visual Arts Minor</b> gives me knowledge in the arts, and the history of it. Taking all the art history classes gave me a good background on what successful art from the past looks like. While all that history is very important to learn about, it was my own personal research that I felt inspired my art style I use today. Through the art classes I took, I was able to incorporate my own unique style to create my works of art. While at Boise State, I have taken an array of visual art classes that have allowed me to really determine what my preferred medium of art is. These classes include drawing, painting, ceramics, sculpting, and printmaking. Through the blood, sweat, and tears of it all, this past semester has been really eye opening for me. While I will always love drawing and digital work, my sculpting class has given me a new passion. In sculpting, we were given the ability to use the woodshop whenever we pleased. This allowed me to have complete creative freedom outside of class to construct whatever I wanted - and what I wanted was to build furniture. This semester I built a coffee table and a matching tv stand from scratch. </p>
<p>My <b>Digital Arts Certificate</b> has given me the confidence to produce digital art in many forms. Coming into college, I had never worked with Adobe Suites, the industry standard for digital artists. Now, after years of schooling, I feel very comfortable using Adobe Illustrator, InDesign, and Photoshop. For the past two years I have building a clothing brand by using my original digital graphics Last summer I was able to secured an internship with FAST Enterprises, a computer software company, and was given the task of creating the digital work for the company (i.e. event detail cards, cocktail signs, updating the website, etc.). </p>
<p>My <b>Plus Business Minor</b> has shown me the ins and outs of business operations. So much goes on behind the scenes of a business and many people do not recognize that. There are many moving parts to a business and all of these parts must be moving at full efficiency in order to run a successful business. Before a product hits the shelf, it goes through a rigorous process of having to be conceptualized, manufactured, marketed, shipped, and finally sold. Obviously this is a simplified run down, but it is no easy process. Through the classes I have taken while pursuing this minor, I have learned five key elements of a successful business - value, singularity, visibility, personality, and vision. I hope to use this minor to work on the marketing side of a business. I already have experience in a marketing environment through my past internship.
