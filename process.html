<h2>The Process</h2>

<p>
    To put my designs onto the clothing, I had to purchase a Cricket vinyl cutter. This machine cuts into vinyl that consists of two layers of material - one being the vinyl, and the other being a see-through sticky material that allows you to stick the cutout vinyl onto the shirt before ironing. Once you have the digital image you want to put on to a piece of clothing, you want to save it as a PNG file. Once your design is cut into the vinyl, you peel off the negative of the cut, leaving just the design. Proceed to iron for 30 seconds, or until the vinyl is attatched to the shirt. Once done, peel of the clear layer of plastic.
