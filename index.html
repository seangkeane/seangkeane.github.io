<h3>What do I need to start kayaking? How do I paddle? Where's the best birdwatching?</h3>
<p><b>By Seth Skwarecki</b></p>
<p>To clear your head and get some easy exercise, the only thing that beats walking is getting out on the water. I’m lucky to live close enough to a lake that I can go for a sunset kayak a few days each week, where I watch birds and sometimes just bring a snack, drop an anchor, and float for a little bit.</p>
<p>I finally bought my own kayak a few years back, and I have absolutely zero regrets. It turned kayaking from a thing I did when the weather was good and the rental place was open, to something I can just do anytime. Here’s what you need to know if you’d like to join me.</p>
<h2>Rent a kayak before you buy one</h2>
<p>Before buying a kayak—which is a good option if you know you’ll use it often—it’s smart to rent one a few times. If you don’t have a way to store and transport it, renting may be your only option anyway. (Although there are inflatable and foldable models, but more about those another time.)</p>

<p>A chiller experience is to rent a kayak from a place on a lake and go out for an hour, or whatever you feel like it. Where I live, nearly every state park has a lake, and nearly every lake has a place where you can rent canoes, single and double kayaks, and sometimes an assortment of other watercraft like rowboats, paddleboats, and stand-up paddleboards.</p>

<h2>How do you paddle, anyway?</h2>

<p>Your first time in a kayak, you will be focused on practical considerations like how the hell do I steer this thing. It’s okay if you don’t think any further ahead than that. (Here, by the way, is a video showing you how to steer this thing.)</p>

<p>A proper paddle stroke uses your core and your lats (upper back) to pull the paddle toward you while you brace your body against the boat. You may also have sore deltoids (shoulders) your first time from the work you’re doing in raising the free end of the paddle out of the water. All told, a hard paddling session is somewhere in between a cardio and a strength workout.</p>
