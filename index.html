        <p>My name is Sean Keane. I am from San Luis Obispo, California. As the son of a graphic design mother and architect father, I was surrounded by art and design from a young age. My interest in art and design knows no end. My other projects include clothing, furniture, and sculpture design. This is just the beginning. </p>

        <p>Coming into college I had no idea what I wanted to pursue as a career.  A lot of paths interested me, but I could not pinpoint what I wanted to do for the rest of my life.  I began college majoring in Construction Management.  After three semesters, I decided it was not for me.  I then changed majors to GIMM (Gaming and Interactive Media and Mobile app design) but decided again, after a semester, I was not a fit.  The next year, my third year, I decided to take a year break from Boise State and take community college classes to save money and to have a better idea of what I want to study.  That brings us to last year.  After reading into all the majors BSU has to offer, I determined Interdisciplinary Studies was the one best suited for me.  With this major, I am able to study multiple different fields that interest me, rather than just one. </p>

        <p>You know the phrase, <q>jack of all trades, master of none</q>? Interdisciplinary study is the embodiment of that phrase. No major on campus offers the same advantages that interdisciplinary study can provide. Having knowledge in a multitude of fields can bring a new perspective to the table that would not have been previously considered. Many jobs today are not hiring based on one specific skill you may have, even if you may excel at that skill, but are looking for someone who has a unique skill set that will tackle issues in a new way.  Being the unconventional major it is, the benefits listed above also come with a challenge or two. The challenges being - not fully learning the ins and outs of a specific field and having employer confusion when applying for jobs.
        </p>

        <p>When I am asked what I study and respond back with Interdisciplinary Studies, the reactions are often very confused. But once I explain what that actually means, people are quick to say how cool and unique of a major it is. Most colleges do not offer a major like Interdisciplinary Studies so it only makes sense to be confused when first learning about it. My specific Interdisciplinary Studies major is made up of two minors and a certificate - Plus Business Minor, Visual Arts Minor, and a Digital Arts Certificate. I chose these minors and certificate because while I knew I wanted to study the visual/media art world, I know that it can be a difficult field to make a living out of. With that being said, I chose to incorporate a Plus Business Minor so I could understand the business side of operations, and essentially help market the products I help create.
