    <h2>About me<h2>  
        <p>I am a fourth year student at Boise State University. Pursuing graphic design, I have always had a keen interest in anything design. Growing up in a creative household with an artist mother and construction father, I was destined to pursue a career in creative endeavours. 
        </p> 

        <p>Over the past few years, I have been quietly working on a clothing brand. One idea led to another, which ultimately led to the development of my brand GRAPHIC [content]. Ever since I can remember, I have always loved minimalistic design - less says more. GRAPHIC [content] uses simple lines to create unique graphics. Inspired by the late Virgil Abloh, GRAPHIC [content] aims to be the future of high end streetwear. 
        </p>

        <p>It can be incredibly difficult for small name artists to make a name for themselves. I wanted to create a platform for these artists to make a name for themselves. That's how the name GRAPHIC [content] was created. The ultimate goal is to display the content of graphic artists on my clothing. In doing so, it creates a collaboration between the brand and the artist, and as a result, boosts recognition for both. </p>
