  <p><b>My passion for all things art, design and furniture building can be traced to my pre-professional days; whether it was studying AutoCAD and blueprints in highschool, majoring in construction management in college for a year, or observing my families constant renovations of our homes, design and creation is engrained in my character.

I have traveled and enjoyed learning about the customs and traditions of others, and believe that has helped me better understand what future clients may need.

    In my freetime, you can find me at my desk brainstorming new design concepts, seeking out inspiration, tackling a nearby trail, or crunching the numbers on my favorite sports team.
