  <p><b>My passion for all things art, design and furniture building can be traced to my pre-professional days; whether studying AutoCAD and blueprints in highschool, majoring in construction management in college for a year, or observing my families constant renovations our homes.
<br>
<br>
    I have traveled and enjoyed learning about the customs and traditions of others, and believe that has helped me to understand better what future clients may need.
<br>    
<br>
    In my office hours you might find me at my desk brainstorming new ideas for furniture design or my clothing brand GRAPHIC [content]. 
<br>
<br>
    When not thinking of my own designs, you can find me seeking out inspiration, tackling a nearby trail, or punching numbers on my favorite sports team.
