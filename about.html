  <p><b>I have a passion for all things art and design - whether it was studying AutoCAD and blueprints in high school, majoring in construction management in college for a year (I switched to Art and Design), or observing my family&#39s constant renovation of homes, design and creation are engrained in my character.

I have traveled and enjoyed learning about the customs and traditions of others, and believe that has helped me better understand what future clients may need.

    In my free time, you can find me at my desk brainstorming new design concepts, seeking out inspiration, tackling a nearby trail, or crunching the numbers of my favorite sports team.
